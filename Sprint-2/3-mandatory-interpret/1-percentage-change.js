// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made?
//There are 5 function calls:
//replaceAll
//Line 4 and 5
//Number(...)
//Line 4 and 5
//console.log()
//Line 10 ,

// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?
//error:line 5,SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list,there is a missing comma between the two arguments "," and " "

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements
//carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""));
//priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", ""));

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations
//let carPrice
//let priceAfterOneYear
//const priceDifference
//const percentageChange

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?
//it removes all commas from the string
//converts the string "10000" into the number 10000
//The purpose is to turn the price from a formatted string into a number
